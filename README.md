My take on the Jobeet tutorial for Symfony 2
========================

This repo follows me going through the Jobeet 2 tutorial from here:
http://www.ens.ro/2012/03/21/jobeet-tutorial-with-symfony2/

I have changed all configuration from yml files to annotations. I also modified the slugify helper function to be a twig extension that can also be called directly as a helper function.

This project will evolve as I make my way through the tutorial.
